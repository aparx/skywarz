## Skywarz - The ultimate Skywars plugin
Skywarz is a very fun Minecraft minigame, that uses animation, very selective sound and particles to express the fun while playing. Skywarz is made for Spigot and Bungeecord servers.

### Plugin installation
Download the latest version of Skywarz (see in Releases section), plug it into your `plugins/` folder, reload your server and you're good to go!
Skywarz requires at least Java 11 and the Minecraft version 1.14 or newer.

### Setup
For more information on how to setup arenas, what the commands, permissions and requirements are, have a look at:
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skywarz.42739/

### Libraries used
Skywarz internally only uses Bufig (Bukkit configuration wrapper) from myself, ORMLite and Guava & commons processing libraries.
